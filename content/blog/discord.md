Since [Discord announced](https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally) it will start asking users for age verification, I became obsessed with reading about alternatives to the platform. And there are a lot of them. As a self-hoster, I immediately thought of Matrix and XMPP. Both have their pros and cons and different implementations.

I was almost ready to pick one of them when I stopped and thought to myself, _would I really use them?_

And my answer is a clear: **No!**

I will not replace Discord because _I don't even use Discord now_. I haven't had an account there for years. When I message my friends, it's either on Signal, WhatsApp, or iMessage, which are all end-to-end-encrypted (E2EE) messengers. The only thing I'm waiting for is E2EE RCS (Rich Communication Services) so I can ditch WhatsApp at some point.
