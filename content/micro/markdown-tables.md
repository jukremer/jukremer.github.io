Tables are arguably the worst part of Markdown.
No horizontal lines except for the mandatory one at the top.
The only feature is the possibility to align cells.

Org Mode does much better, but isn't perfect either.

Don't get me wrong. It's nice to have a simple tool for simple tables.
But sometimes I need more customizability.
